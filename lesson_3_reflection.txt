When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
If you are working on a collaborative project or if you want to back a project up to the cloud
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
in case you are working on something setperately and don't want to those changes to be polluted on your own branch yet.
